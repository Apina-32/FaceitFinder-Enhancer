# FaceitFinder-Enhancer
Fetches and displays cs:go competitive and Esportal ranks in faceitfinder.com

The code is in desprate need of refactoring, since this started as a proof of concept and still is that.

There are some not so optimal practices used due to the nature of this script and due to the original sites implementation.

### Features
- Adds matchmaking ranks for players
- Shows matchmaking wins for players
- Shows actual playtime for players
- Shows latest faceit match acquired from faceit api
- Show esportal rank acquired from Esportal api
